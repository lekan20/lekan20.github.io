I had a lot more confidence going into The Sinatra Portfolio project than I did for the Ruby one. This wasn’t an unknown challenge to me. I knew it would be a good amount of work, I’d stumble, but I knew I’d get through it. Even with my confidence, I wasn’t going to be stupid and go in cocky. I knew that I had a challenge in front of me and I was excited for that rather than scared. I knew the concepts I’m weak at would be exposed and allow for me to improve them. While the things I know will get reinforced.

Even with that positive outlook, this project got me frustrated! I used the given checklists, I noted the labs I would reference to assist me to build my idea. And mentally, I don’t know why, but I always assume there’ll be no stumbles, and I want there to be no stumbles, but finishing this lab wouldn’t be as rewarding if it was easy. 

As I said, I followed the given checklists, I had labs to reference, and videos to use. Even with all of those resources, I made my first stumble creating a new git repository when there was already one attached the lab. As Will Smith says, “Fail Fast, it’s the fastest way to success” I guess I took that to heart.

I spent a lot of this lab dubbing my code, follow old labs made me fell everything would run smoothly, but of course there are pot holes and bumps on your trip to your destination. I spent a lot of time dubbing code, googling Sinatra authentication, flash messages, for hours, to find out that I misspelled something or attached a params to the wrong value. 

But I understand the bigger value in that. I understand the journey that got me to finishing this lab and the lessons I learned. I’m sure next time, I’ll check to make sure my syntax is correct (actually I probably won’t, it definitely takes messing up a lot of times before it sticks), I’ll continue to use pry to make sure my code hits specific lines. 

I’m learning the beauty of software engineering comes from this back and forth of messing up and learning from. Then answers don’t come fast and you need to try things to see if the error changes. That’s always something I’m trying to get myself to acknowledge and practice. I’m happy these projects are continuing that journey for me.

If my rails assessment was a gym session, it felt as like I trained for a body building contest instead of going through planet fitnesses 6 step six pack machines. Throughout the rails section, any time I got to a new lab, I'd look at other classmates labs to get an idea of where to start and to give me an outline of where to go but for this assessment, it didn't work like that. Every had the same guidelines to create their project but everyone's project differed. DAMN, now I have idea running through my head but no one's project to help guide me. 

I settled on using the last lab, Rails Amusement Park, to guide me. When I first read the description for the project, I knew I wanted to make a Bodega but didn't know how to make that happen. The Rails Amusement Park had elements, I knew I could use to reflect the buying process of going into a store.  That let me take my first step and I thought would bring me to the promise land, but it lead me to even more confusion.

I knew, I'd have to have three associations, Users, Purchases, and Items but how could I use these to resemble a list of everything you bought? First I tried to create a update my join table and a cart_id, items, belong_to the cart (and update the appropriate associations). But anytime I tried to add the item to a cart I got a Stack Level Too Deep error.

After reading blog posts on Ruby Shopping Carts I created a new migration, OrderItems, that took in the purchase_id and the user_id. Id then try to use that to display the purchases but I felt like that got repititive. I felt stuck. When this happens, I'll go into myself and think I have to figure this out, I don't need help. But I spent hours and couldn't come to a solution.

Finally, I reached out to the section lead. There's a part of me that feels weak having to ask for help, feels like it means I'm not smart enough to figure this out. But, I know I'm wrong. And with a few back and forth emails, Luisa gave me one suggestion that broke me out of my 10 hour funk.

This journey isn't something I'll complete on my own and no one successful, or that breaks through their obstacles, never does it alone. And that's a muscle, I need to work out. Asking for help, and not just asking for help expecting someone to fix everything I'm struggling with, with one suggestion. I need to work with them and ask questions that are vague but ask questions that allow them to work with me and grow. Not focusing on finsihing but enjoying the journey. 

Everytime I finish an assessment, it's a really good feeling. But for all the work I put into this, I really feel sastisfaction from the process, learning the concepts, and making something that I had in mind happen. 

I always remind myself to focus on the process but this project really, really, really, really, made me learn to appreciate that. The furstrations and blocks are all apart of it. No matter how frustrating they are to go through.

I knew I’ve learned a lot of new skills in the past few months but I didn’t know how I would build this. The thought of finally making it to the final project, not knowing how to build it, getting stuck on this, and never finishing it crossed my mind. I was soooo excited to finally get here but my past experiences with programming did not go so well no matter how excited I felt about the project. Even though I was scared I knew going through this lab is an opportunity to see how I’m staking up, what I know, and what I need to learn more about. I broke my next moves into a few steps:

Step 1: Read all the resources I’m given

Step 2: Watch EVERY video

Step 3: Curve my imagine a little bit. Even though my imagination and my creativity can really help me with this lab… I know it can bite off more than it could chew at times. And that didn’t mean I couldn’t get to where I wanted but I want to get there one step at a time.

Step 4: Break down what I need to do in steps

Step 5: Choose the website I want to scrape

Step 6. Do it

I knew I wanted to scrape NBA standings and the individual team stats but could I do it!?!?!? I fully believed that no matter how much I broke it down I wouldn’t get there but I decided to work my way there, see if I proved myself wrong, or make little changes if it didn’t work for me.

I followed the breakdown video step by step for my use case. Testing what Avi tested, reading what Avi told us to read. The approach a building from bigger picture to more specifics really helped me understand what I wanted my CLI to do and what to test if it broke down. 

Anytime I had a question that the video didn’t answer or a test that didn’t work that worked in the video, I asked posted it in slack and asked other people in the community what they thought and their advice to fix it. 

When I finally got to building my objects and scraping data from ESPN.com, I used prys to see why my code wasn’t working and figure out what I needed to change to get the result I wanted. 

And to my amazement I BUILT IT!!! I got it to work and it feels AMAZING. I feel like I hit the winning shot at the buzzer, like I ate the most delicious meal at Peter Lugar’s. I can’t believe it worked out and I’m really happy it did.

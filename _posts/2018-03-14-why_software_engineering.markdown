From before I can remember I wanted to be an architect. I always loved to build and create things. In preschool I'd take breaks from playing with my friends to use the blocks to build a replica of the Brooklyn bridge. I loved going to school and seeing my friends so I did whatever I could not to miss a day... except the day after my mom bought me a lego airport set. I begged and pleaded so much my mom let me stay home to build it. 

At Haverford College, I had the opportunity to explore my love of creation. I took many classes in architecture, but the stand out class would have to be architectural design. In this class, I was challenged with building a chair from corrugated cardboard without any adhesive, in which the Professor tested it by sitting for 10 seconds without breaking it. I took similar classes throughout my tenure at Haverford, using different mediums to create pieces using only the things around me. 

My childhood passion transitioned into a post-graduate position as a Superintendent for Turner Construction Company. While at Turner, I learned how to navigate the business of people; working with subcontractors and managing projects. Not only was I responsible for the execution, but also how to effectively manage teams with goals that countered mine. I found that other people in my position took the approach of bossing the subcontractors around, giving strict direction in a threatening manner. After watching these interactions, I decided to approach the position differently, working to understand the challenges the subcontractors faced so I could be a partner to get the job completed, rather than an obstacle in their way. Little did I realize, the time I had spent learning to building physical items, also taught me how to effectively build relationships, which both help to achieve the desired outcomes. 

After four years at Turner, I had an itch to transition into the tech world. I wanted to be a part of something innovative and that offered constant challenges. I began working at Fieldlens, taking a giant leap into something completely new and unknown to me. I was excited for my position as a Customer Success manager to learn new skills and be a novice soaking up all the information I could from my team and others in the company. After a year and a half at Fieldlens, I've realized my interest in tech was much deeper than being a voice at the end of a phone. I enjoy helping users learn the product and become successful, but I dream of building and creating the features that bring value to the users.

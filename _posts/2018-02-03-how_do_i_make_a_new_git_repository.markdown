**Step 1:** Google "Create a new git repository on Github"
https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/

Okay, I created it... now what next? hmmm

**Step 2:** Look back in learn to see what information we have on this because I know there are lessons.
https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v3/git-and-github/git/git-repository-basics

Maybe this should've been step one. Looks like I could've created my repository from my learn terminal. I guess I'll use that the next time. 

**Step 3:** Find out how to add the repository I created to my Learn IDE terminal.
https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v3/git-and-github/github/git-forks-and-clones

I checked learn first this time. I think I'll have to Fork this lab.
https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.2/user/articles/fork-a-repo/ Super usefule article from Github linked to the learn article above. Even though I made my repository on Github I can clone it to my desktop and mess around with it. Which I thought was the case but I didn't know how.

I went back into the learn article with my information from the Github article and the learn article has some good pictures and instructions I'll take a shot on... Here. We. Go. (Why do I always feel like something will explode when I try it?)

**Step 4:** Ok, I've cloned it but where is it!?
I did a ls on in the terminal and see my NBA-Stats-CLI-Gem so I cd'd into it. 

I assumed I'd see a folder in my terminal under code but I don't see it but the NBA-Stats-CLI-Gem exists. So I guess it's there.

**Step 5:** How do I commit my changes to the repo???
https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v3/git-and-github/github/git-remotes-and-github
This article showed me how to do it

git init
git add .
git commit -m "notes"

I still don't get why I don't see the repo visually in my terminal.

Actually, I don't see my commit in my repo in github. Lets read more.

Not sure what's giong on but definitely getting pretty frustrated and not sure how to articulate this when asking for help.

I'm quitting out of my terminal, gonna reopen it, and then ask people in slack if they can help me.

No one answered my question in slack so I'll ask one of the learn coaches.

Someone ended up coming up in the slack channel to give me suggestions and a learn coach jumped on a screen share with me.

Turns out I had to move it (mv NBA-Stat-CLI-Gem code) and once we moved it there I could see it.


**Step 6** Push changes to git hub

After all I'm doing and the commits I've made, I don't see anything on Github. I realized I need to push my code to github off of my computer. I used the article in **Step 5** to show me how (git push -u origin master).

Man All of this took two hours to find this repo and I got pretty stuck but I know I gotta keep trying stuff no matter how frustrated I get. These are all learning opportunities.

It always feels like 1 step forward 2 steps back but I'm starting to learn that's all progress. Doesn't matter if I'm going forward or backward I'm still learning something that'll help me as I keep going.

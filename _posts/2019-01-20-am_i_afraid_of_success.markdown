My fainc√© and I have an 8 year old English Bulldog names Olive. Even at 8 she has the energy of a 6 week old puppy and more than anything loves to challenge you to tug of war with anyone of her toys. The can really hurt (especially the ones iwth a rope) once she wins and shakes her head like you felt an unwanted spider drop onto your head. The few times I win, she of course wants to continue playing, so I throw it across the room for her to chase and bring back to me. But this is where the drama ensues. 

I'll throw the toy across the room and nine times out of ten Olive runs over without thinking, grabs, the toy, and runs it back to me. Unless, it hits an object and makes a noise. Now, I live in a small NYC apartment, there's nothing in there that Olive hasn't seen before. In reality, she spends more time there than I do but once that toy hits a chair, the garbage can, etc she's freaked out and won't do what she does every other time without thinking.

She'll run up to the toy, look at it, like it's an alien species and bark. She'll act like this is a life form never seen before. Then she'll use her little paw to tap it as if she's a two year old at their first swim lesson that isn't sure if the water is like every other floor they've walked on, a endless fall to the floor, or even worse.. something they can't even rationalize. 

Olive won't grab the toy unless Laura and I continue to encourage her to take a chace and remind her that she can get it. Then she'll bring it back to use once she acquires enough courage, realizes it's not as a bad as it seems, and that it's the same toy she's always played with. 

This is how I feel about my fourth Portfolio Project. Yes, I've done this three other times and yes I've done well enough to continue with the course, three times but I still feel like Olive checking to see if the Toy is Safe. I'm rereading lessons and watching videos (which I do need to do) but I'm dodging the most important part of finishing the project... Taking action.

This project really helped me get out of my silo, programming by myself and trying to figure out every question, to incorporate myself into the community. I reached out to the internal slack channel in addition to the section coaches anytime I got stuck. In the past, I'd set the community up to fail. I'd flately ask a question like, "This won't work, help me!" or  "I'm getting this error, how do I fix it?". Yeah some people may chime in but that's a lot for them to work off of.  I adjusted myself to tell people what I'm trying to do, show them my code, give them a link to the full repo, maybe send a video, and tell them my issue." This approach worked a lot better! I asked 11 questions and they all were answered!

In the past I've been embarrassed to ask questions. I've always felt that I should just know everything and have everything we've learned stored in my head like a computer. And only ask questions that I felt weren't answered in our lessons but I had to get out of my own head. Asking quesitons made me act like Olive after her toy hit something that made noise. And taking action over and over has helped me work through my fears and get to an awesome place with my project. 

I'm really proud of how far I've come and how much I continue to grow. This has been a long road that somettimes feel like I'll never finish it. But I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and really learn how to think like a Software Engineer. It's really awesome!
